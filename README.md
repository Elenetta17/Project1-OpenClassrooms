# Project1-OpenClassrooms
Analyze data from education systems

## Business Case

The mission consists of an exploratory analysis to determine if the World Bank education dataset (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics) helps inform the expansion project of an on-line learning company. The database lists 4000 international indicators describing access to education, graduation and information related to teachers and education expenditure.

These indicators may not all be relevant, so it will be necessary to filter the data to retrieve and analyze the most important indicators. In addition, it will be necessary to clean the database of duplicates and/or missing values.

Finally, it will be necessary to develop a score to classify the countries according to their potential for commercial development.
